# thermostat challenge - Week 6 Makers

Thermostat that changes cover image based on temperature (when below 18 degrees it flips to the winter scene - perhaps a bit dramatic but I feel the cold!).

Bugs to be fixed -
1. On load it does not have a background image
2. It does not tell you whether power saving mode is on or off until you click it (by default it is on and it should say so)
3. Winter image doesn't have great readability.
